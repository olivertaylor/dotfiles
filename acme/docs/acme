OPENING FILES

It feels strange, but just create a new window
and type the path to the file you want to edit.
Then, click-drag with right-click.
You can use ^f to complete paths.


WINDOWS

'Zerox' duplicates the current window so you can edit different part of it.

Scroll-bar:

	Left-Click to scroll down.
	Right-click to scroll up.
	The further down you click the more lines it scrolls.
	Alt-Click in the scrollbar to jump to that spot.

Layout Box:

	Click - expands window in column, pushing others away.
	Click-drag - positions window without effecting others.
	Middle-click - expands window, leaving other window-tags visible.
	Right-click - expand window, hiding others. Clicking another button brings them back.


MOUSE

Note: Acme follows the UNIX convention of focus following the mouse.
So whatever field your mouse is overing over, that's where you'll type.

You can click on words and Acme figures out the scope.
Or you can act on a selection by dragging with the button held down.

	- button 1 (click) - Selecting text
	- button 1 double click - select word, or at end/start of line, select line.
	- button 2 (middle-click, alt-click) - executing
	- button 3 (right-click) - plumb for text / if fail, search for text

	  Selecting files opens them.
	  Selecting words selects next.

Double-click on words to select them
Double-click just to the left/right of brackets/parenthesis to select contents


SHORTCUTS

	ctrl-u delete from cursor to start of line
	ctrl-w delete word before the cursor
	ctrl-h delete character before the cursor
	ctrl-a move cursor to start of the line
	ctrl-e move cursor to end of the line
	
	ctrl-f filepath autocompletion

Press esc to select the last typed text.
Press esc again to cut.
If you have text selected, pressing esc cuts it.

To insert special characters, like ยง
press ALT then the characters indicated here: /usr/local/plan9port/lib/keyboard 


MOUSE CORDING ON MACOS

Alt+Click = Execute
Cmd+Click = Look/Plumb
Ctrl+Click = Click

Select + tap Alt = cut
Select + tap Cmd = Paste
(combine to copy)

With text selected,
alt-click a command, then tap control, and release everything.
This passes the selected text as an argument to the alt-clicked command.

Tap Esc to select recently inserted text.
Tap again to cut (or just with a selection).


MOUSE / TRACKPAD CHORDS

Modify clicks:

	Command: right-click
	Option: middle-click

After a click-drag/hold:

	Tap option: Cut
	Tap command: Paste


EXECUTING

Text anywhere (really anywhere) can be executed.

Select something you want to cut and execute this word: Cut.
Then move somewhere else and execute this word: Paste.

If the cursor is at the end of "date" then alt-clicking anywhere in that window will execute "date".

You can run external commands too.
To get a new window with the results, execute:

	date

To pipe the selection to a command, and replace, prefix with a pipe.

	|ucase

To use selection is input, but NOT replace with output:

	>aspell -a
	>spell

To insert the results of a command without providing input, do:

	<date


LOADING

Load text by cmd-clicking on it.

	/Users/otc/src/dot/acme/notes/acme
	/Users/otc/src/dot/acme/notes/acme:3                (line 3)
	/Users/otc/src/dot/acme/notes/acme:3-+#8
	/Users/otc/src/dot/acme/notes/acme:3:9             (line 3, column 9)
	/Users/otc/src/dot/acme/notes/acme:/^LOADING/,/$/

- Use this to create hyperlinks between files


EDIT COMMANDS

See also: /Users/otc/src/dot/acme/notes/sam

This replaces 'a' with 'A' in the entire file

	Edit , s/a/A/g

Selection only:

	Edit s/a/A/g

Lines 1-10:

	Edit 1,10 s/a/A/g

You can middle-drag the commands, or you can
type these in the tag and select it, then middle-click on the selection.


SEARCHING

You can always search for a word by clicking on the same word.
If you want to regexp search:

	:/^\thello

To find the current line number:

	Edit =

This is useful if you want to make a bookmark and come back later.
Which you can do with:

	:43 (takes you to line 43)


COMMANDS

Look at acme(1)

Indent on/off - auto-indent next line based on current line

Look - Search for selected text, or for text following command.
       You might ask, "how is this different than right-clicking?"
       Use it for when you want to search a file for a filename.
	If you cmd-click a filename then it will open that file
	rather than search the current file for that name
       

OPTIONS

-a	start with autoindent on
-f	variable-pitch font
-F	fixed-width font
-l	load dump file
-c	start acme with one column
-b	insertion of text does not follow mouse

--------------------------------

With text selected, pressing delete deletes the selected text AND
the character immediately to the left.

The Gave Accent and Right Single Quote display as the same character.
I gather it is related to that oulined here:
