ADDRESSES

[absolute]
13		Line 13
13,15	Lines 13,15
0		Beginning of file
$		End of file
.		Current text

0,$		Entire file (can also just be written as ",")
.,13		Current text to line 13

[relative]
.+/sam/	Search from current text forward for "sam"
0+/sam/	First occurance of "sam" in the file
$-/sam/	Last occurance of "sam" in the file

This sets the "dot" to the first "sam" after current text to final "acme" in file:

	.+/sam/,0-/acme/

LOOPS

x/pattern/command		Loops over current file
X/pattern/command		Loops over ALL files

commands:
	a	append
	c	change
	i	insert (which is really prepend)
	d	delete
	s	substitute
	m	move
	t	copy

Change all occurances of "Emacs" in the file to "vi"

	0,$x/Emacs/c/vi/

,x/^/a/	/	Indent all lines in file by a tab
,x/^	/d		Remove tab-indents

CONDITIONALS

	,x/Emacs/ x/E/ c/e/

(Spaces can be used to separate commands on a line
to make them easier to read.)
What this command does is find all occurrences of Emacs (,x/Emacs/),
and then with dot set to that text, find all occurrences of the letter E (x/E/),
and then with dot set to that text, run the command c/e/
to change the E character to lower case.

	g/pattern/command

This runs the command if dot contains the pattern, without changing dot.

	,x/.*\n/ g/Emacs/p

	,z/.*\n/		breaks the file into lines
	g/Emacs/		for each line that contains "Emacs",
	p			print it.

	,x/.*\n/ x/Emacs/p

This command would only print "Emacs" for each match
because x/Emacs sets the dot to the match.

	v	Opposite of g, rejects matches
	y	Between matches

GROUPING

	,x/Emacs|vi/{
		g/Emacs/ c/vi/
		g/vi/ c/Emacs/
	}

Set the dot to all occurences of "Emacs" or "vi",
if "Emacs", change to "vi",
if "vi", change to "Emacs".

These changes happen IN PARRALLEL.
Therefore, the Emacs command does not happen before the vi command.

	"all changes to the file refer to the state of the file
	before any of the changes in that command are made.
	After all the changes have been determined,
	they are all applied simultaneously."

	"An indirect ramification is that changes
	must occur in forward order through the file,
	and must not overlap."

	Edit ,x/Acme/ {
		i/I love 
		c/Acme-Sam
		a/ editor!
	}

1. Find all occurences of "Acme" in the file,
2. Prepend "I Love"
3. Change the match to "Acme-Sam",
4. Append " editor!"

	1,2 >wc	Provides lines 1-2 to wc
	,| sort	Sorts all lines in a file
