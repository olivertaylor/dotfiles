1. Clone https://github.com/9fans/plan9port to /usr/local/

2. Add this to your zshenv:

	# This is required for parts of acme/plan9 to work
	export PLAN9=/usr/local/plan9port

	# Also add this to your path, to get all the plan9 scripts in there
	export PATH=$PATH:~/cloud/src/dot/bin:~/cloud/src/dot/acme/bin:$PLAN9/bin

3. Only launch acme via ../bin/acme - which is super important because
it gives you nice fonts and sets up plumber correctly.
