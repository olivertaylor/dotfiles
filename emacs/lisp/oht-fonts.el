;; RESEARCH AREA
;; ----------------------------------------------

;; I'm experimenting with setting buffer-local fonts.
;; The below code works most of the time but is very fragile,
;; chalk it up to me not knowing how the code actually works.

;; The limitation I'm trying to get around is this:
;; Most variable-width fonts are optically smaller than monospaced ones.
;; So you want to scale the variable-width font, but doing that screws up the
;; fixed-pitch font when you're not in variable-width-mode.

;; To get around this I'm toying with setting buffer-local fonts on mode-hooks
;; or functions so I can control it.

;; 1. Set the default, variable- and fixed-width fonts.
;; 2. Create a variable-pitch-mode hook which sets a new fixed-width size.
;; 3. Create an exit hook to reset it correctly.
